# Trashpile's Solana program

## About

This program has one function: `dump`, which receives some amount of an SPL token in exchange for 1 $TRASH token.

Build and deploy via:

1. `npm run compile_program`
2. `npm run deploy_program`
3. `npm run test_program`

## ToDo

1. add rate limiting or equivalent
2. figure out how best to delegate upgrade authority to the community
3. add dumpster diving functionality
